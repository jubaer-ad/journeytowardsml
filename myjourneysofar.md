# Links of materials I have learned so far:

===========================================================================
## Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate
(https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics)
I have completed 8 out of 8 courses here but got 7 certificates due to financial crisis. I got this program for free under Commonwealth of Learning Skills for Work - Bangladesh. After completeing 8 course (out of 8) and getting first 7 certificate, the free access got expired (thanks to my laziness over first couple of months). Planning subscribing coursera and getting final certificate as well.
